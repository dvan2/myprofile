          I'm a Computer Science student at Portland State University soon to be
          graduating in 2024. Learning about CS was a thrill. I got an
          understanding of how computers work from the very basics. How binary
          1's and 0's are turned into logic gates and are used to build
          languages, compilers and data structures. It's amazing that we are
          able to come this far in technological advancement and it's amazing
          that there are many brilliant people who created all these together. I
          am always eager to learn more as I continue my career in Computer
          Science.

          Last summer I interned at Lam Research in Order Fulfillment team. The
          work was mainly focused on extracting data from software and analyzing
          for potential errors and malformated data. Prior to this, I've worked
          at Portland Parks and Recreation which focous on working together as a
          team.
